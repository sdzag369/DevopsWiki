# Creating a Webhook between Jenkins and Github

### Why use webhook ? 

> Till now we have seen how to trigger a build using SCM. However one major flaw in this approach is that you have to trigger these builds manually. We need a mechanism (automation) to ensure that whenever your code is committed to any selected branch on SCM(usually master), jenkins should trigger the build automatically. In order to achieve that, we will use Github as our primary Git repository and create a webhook from Jenkins to Github. Jenkins will automatically track all changes made on the Github repository and will trigger a new build whenever you merge your code to master. 

## Configurations for webhook 

* Go to Jenkins Dashboard by clicking the jenkins icon on the top left

> Github now has a webhook set up with Jenkins. In order to test the functionality, we will use an existing job, **scmdemo** in our folder **MyFirstFolder**. 

* In Jenkins go inside your folder *MyFirstFolder* 

* Click on the Job *scmdemo* 

* On the left Panel select *configure* 

* The configure option let you edit the previous configurations 

* In the **General** tab check **GitHub project** 

* Provide the base URL of your github repository 

* In my case the base url is `https://github.com/hub-kubernetes/jenkinscode`

* In the **Build Trigger** section  select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**

* Click Save

> Now that we have the job configured, make any changes in your github master repository. You should see that the webhook will launch automatically and a new build will be kicked off.
