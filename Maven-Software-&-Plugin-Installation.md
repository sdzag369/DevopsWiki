# Maven Installation

## What is Maven ? 

> Apache Maven is a free and open source project management and comprehension tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) which is essentially a XML file containing information about the project, configuration details, the projectâ€™s dependencies, and so on.

## Where will be maven installed? 

> Maven will be installed on all hosts that can trigger builds. We have one master and one slave which both can trigger builds. Hence, maven will be installed on both servers 

## Are there any prerequisite? 

> Since Apache Maven works majorly with Java projects, you need to have Java installed. If you are following this series of demos java would be installed already on your system while installing Jenkins. 

## Installation steps 

> The below command will be installed on both - master and slave nodes 

` apt-get update && apt-get install -y maven`

Check the version by executing - 

` mvn -version` 

## Install maven plugin on Jenkins 

> Jenkins might not come with the maven plugin by default. We will have to install Jenkins plugin for maven builds
